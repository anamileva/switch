    Add tp_date parameter to identify which date each timepoint falls on
    
    This is used by modules that enforce constraints between hours of the
    same date (e.g., hydrogen production or simple demand response). It
    defaults to be the same as the timeseries, which works fine if each
    timeseries is one day long. But if models use multi-day timeseries,
    they should specify a code for the corresponding date for each timepoint
    in the tp_date column of inputs/timepoints.csv.

    Add generator retrofit capability (switch_model.generators.extensions.retrofit)
    
    The switch_model.generators.extensions.retrofit module makes it possible to
    define retrofits for existing generators. These are done by defining a new
    generation project that can replace a previously built one (i.e., it performs
    like the original generator plus the retrofit) and adding columns to
    `gen_retrofits.csv` showing all allowed combinations of base projects that can
    be replaced by retrofit projects. In each row, `base_gen_project` shows the
    name of the original (base) project and `retrofit_gen_project` shows the name
    of a retrofit project that can replace it.
    
    Retrofit projects will only be built if the base project has also been built
    in the same or an earlier period. When a base project is retrofitted, the base
    project is suspended (via SuspendGen) and the retrofit version is built and
    operated instead. In addition, retrofit projects are automatically suspended
    at the end of life of the base project. (To enable these behaviors,
    gen_can_retire_early or gen_can_suspend must be set to True or 1 in
    gen_info.csv for both the base project and the retrofit version.)
    
    Because of this framing, retrofitted projects will have capital expenditure
    equal to the capital recovery for the base project plus capital recovery for
    the retrofit project. So gen_overnight_cost for the retrofit project should be
    set equal to the cost of the retrofit work, not the combined project. However,
    fixed and variable O&M will no longer be collected for the base project, so
    O&M cost inputs for the retrofit project should be the ones that apply for the
    total retrofitted project.
    
    Capital recovery for the retrofitted project will be amortized over the
    remaining life of the base project that it replaces, which may cause faster
    capital recovery than would otherwise be expected for these assets.

    Implement --retire {early, mid, late} flag
    
    This flag controls whether to retire projects at the start of the period
    when they reach end-of-life ('early') (i.e., only run if they survive to
    the end of the period), or retire them if they survive past the middle of
    the period ('mid'), or extend operation to the end of the period when
    they reach end-of-life ('late'). Late is the default and matches
    previous behavior by Switch. Early and mid match some other models'
    behavior.

    Add early retirement and suspsension for generators
    
    Setting gen_can_retire_early or gen_can_suspend flags to True or 1 in
    gen_info.csv enables generators to be retired permanently or temporarily
    suspended before they reach their maximum age. In both cases, the amount of
    capacity of a particular vintage that is offline in a given period will be
    shown by the SuspendGen variable. These both default to False/0, and
    gen_can_suspend will take precedence (temporary suspension will be allowed)
    if both are set to True/1.
    
    GenCapacity now reports only capacity that has not been suspended, and a
    new column in gen_cap.csv, SuspendGen_total, shows the total capacity in
    each generation project that is suspended/inactive in each period.
    
    Suspended generators avoid fixed O&M costs, but must continue to pay
    capital recovery (amortized capital costs) as normal.

    Add `--scenario-argument-values <scenario-name>` option to `switch info` api
    
    This reads the current arguments for the specified scenario (or the base
    scenario if no name is provided) and reports them back as a dictionary
    with the destination for each argument as the key.
    
    This commit also updates `switch info --module-arguments` to report the
    destination for each argument so it can be cross-referenced if needed.

    add `switch info` with `--module-list` and `--module-arguments <modname>` flags
    
    We are in the process of implementing a GUI wrapper for Switch, which will work
    with a bundled copy of Switch that runs as a command-line application. The GUI
    app needs a way to learn which modules are available and which arguments they
    take. This provides that capability. Results will be pretty printed to stdout
    as Python code by default (generally not very useful, but maybe for diagnosis),
    or sent as json code if the --json flag is used (best for calling from other
    programs).
    
    The `--module-list` flag gives a list of all available modules in the search
    path. In the future this will be updated to return them in the order they can
    appear in modules.txt.
    
    The `--module-arguments <modname>` command reports all the command-line
    arguments that can be accepted by module <modname>.
