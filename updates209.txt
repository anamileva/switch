    Balance EV charging by date instead of timeseries in hawaii.ev
    
    This will require full charging every day when using multi-day
    timeseries, rather than allowing EVs to delay charging multiple
    days, possibly exceeding their storage capacity.

    Add pumped storage option to switch_model.generators.extensions.hydro_system
    
    When using the `hydro_system` module, hydro generators can now be designated as
    reversible (able to do pumped hydro storage) by setting `gen_storage_efficiency`
    in `gen_info.csv` to a numeric value (generally 0.5 - 1.0). To use this feature
    you must also add `switch_model.generators.extensions.storage` somewhere above
    `switch_model.generators.extensions.hydro_system` in `modules.txt`.
    
    When generators are identified as reversible, water can be pumped from the node
    below the generator to the one above, with the specified round-trip efficiency.
    The nodes above and below the generator should have reservoir data in
    reservoirs.csv to indicate the amount of storage available.
    
    The storage module now defines a new set called ALL_STORAGE_GENS, which will
    rarely be used. This is the union of pumped-storage hydro generators and
    standard storage generators (usually batteries), which are still listed in
    STORAGE_GENS.

    Track hydro reservoir levels by timeseries instead of period
    
    The hydro_system module now tracks reservoir levels over the course of each
    timeseries instead of each period. Previously the hydro_system module tracked
    levels of reservoirs across all the timepoints in a period, as if each
    timeseries was linked to the one after it. This was an error, and in models
    with multiple timeseries with different weights, Switch could retain water
    during low-weight timeseries, then release it during high-weight timeseries,
    effectively producing free energy.
    
    The new approach matches the general principle in Switch that each timeseries is
    independent and it must be possible to to repeat each timeseries many times in a
    row if necessary. Although this is more correct than the previous approach, it
    is also more conservative: hydro networks must reach the same level (or a
    prespecified level) at the start and end of each timeseries, instead of the
    start and end of each period.
    
    Users should now set res_initial_vol and res_final_vol for each timeseries in
    reservoir_ts_data.csv instead of setting initial_res_vol and final_res_vol for
    each period in reservoirs.csv. The standard upgrade script will automatically
    make this change if needed. It will also interpolate between the previous
    full-period reservoir volumes to set the reservoir volumes at the start and end
    of each timeseries.
    
    For models with a single, long timeseries for each period (the most common use
    case for this module), this change won't make a difference. However, for models
    with multiple timeseries in each period with different weights, this update
    may change the model results.
    
    In addition, res_initial_vol and res_final_vol are now optional. If
    res_initial_vol is set but not res_final_vol, Switch will set the final level
    equal to the initial level. If neither is set, Switch will choose an optimal
    initial volume for each timeseries and also return to that level at the end of
    the timeseries. (For most models, it is best not to set res_final_vol, so Switch
    will return the reservoir to the starting level. This makes it possible to have
    an arbitrary number of repetitions of each timeseries.)
